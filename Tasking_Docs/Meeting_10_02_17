What will we name the business? I was thinking PWN PEN & PARTNERS (PP&P)? We need something that will let people know what type of industry that we are in

Notes from the actual meeting:
we should focus on developing a mailing when we begin working on out content
we also must create disclaimers to protect us from any fraudulent use of the content

1. What type of content should we create?
	*short video that are not overly technical
	*reach cyber practitioners who have no technical foundation as well as the novice
	*security for dummies (noobs  to profesionals)

2. Rcognition?? ( What is the longterm plan for this business) (firm or hobby)?

3. Content must be created together as well as disperced
	*equipment
	*management of content
	*approval before releasing the content (review cycle)

4. We should be teaching and always considering both the offensive and defensive side of our profession
	*think like a hacker to stop one

5. Finish the python text with the cybrary content as prep for the OSCP


I will generate talking points for the next meeting that we have
